# Refug-Assist
## Inspiration: üí°
We all know how much the Palestinians have suffered lately, seeing the amount of tough time these refugees had to go through we arrived at the idea of Refug-Assist. The majority of the masses face a lot of financial crises due to forced immigration. Hence we came up with the solution to provide a job portal that shall help these refugees get a job and live a decent life in the countries they have landed in.

Almost majority of the population out their face a problem of availing medical facilities let alone the consultation and due to this pandemic, many people were faced with problems such as transportation or unavailability of doctors to tend to their diseases, which sparked an idea in our minds to build a consultancy system which not makes it cheap and affordable to the financially stricken people or people who need immediate information regarding what disease they are suffering from, but also help them identify the seriousness of the disease or cancer that's taken root in them. We were inspired by the many possibilities the latest tech like Image segmentation using Machine Learning can help us solve the impending problem that the people facing in this pandemic situation.

## What does it do?:
 It helps in finding jobs for the refugees. Contains multiple options like job creation, updation, application, and job deletion.
We have labelled our health section as Cordal Care, it predicts different cancer diseases like Alzheimer's, chest, lung, skin cancer and produces output as a possibility and also integrated a management system for admin, doctor, and patient respectively so we can book an appointment with doctor online and don't have to wait in a queue outside the hospital to diagnose ourselves.

## How we built it ‚ùì
we built this project in various languages like; CSS, C#, ASP.NET, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, HTML, PYTHON

## Challenges we ran into üé¢
The number of challenges that we faced was no joke, Time was a constraint as we had to schedule our time for this project from our day-to-day hectic schedule, during execution, there were errors where we had to focus on debugging them. The biggest obstacle that stood in front of us was in integrating Machine Learning to Asp.net, which we were able to pull of using python. Overcoming all the challenges we were able to create an outstanding innovative project which makes us proud of building it and some trouble with the code as well, but all of that apart we all feel very proud that overcame all those problems and created a beautiful website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÖüèÜ
The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; we understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.

## What we learned üìö
We learned a lot from this hackathon from time management, team working skills, the code itself, and also a lot of different diseases. We are very glad that we got so much out of this hackathon.

## What's next for Refug-Assist ?:üî≠
 Add more ML models and create a dashboard for the management system.
